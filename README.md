# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e., leave a service). The goal is to help businesses retain customers by identifying those at risk.

## 🚀 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest
- Confusion matrix and accuracy visualization

---

## 📁 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical features)
3. Split data into train and test sets
4. Train a classification model
5. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
6. Make predictions on new/unseen data

## 📊 Model Performance

- Achieved **X% accuracy** on test data
- Visualized results using confusion matrix and classification report

---

## 🧠 Use Case

Useful for telecom, banking, or any subscription-based business to identify and retain customers who are likely to churn.
